# Prework-Module-04

## Description 

This page is one of the first "projects" from the Prework Assignments during the course.

The project was to create a page with your current knowledge for your favorite band. I don't have a favorite band, so I picked what was playing while I did the assignment. 

The band was a band called "Flipturn" from Florida. 

**DISCLAIMER** Trust the process! ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜…ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥³
